<p><font size="-1"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Worrisome topics, such as climate change, economic crises, or the Covid-19 pandemic, are increasingly present and pervasive due to digital media and social networks. Do such worries affect cognitive performance? The effect of a distressing topic might be very different depending on whether people have the scope and means to cope with the consequences. It can also differ by how performance is rewarded, for instance, if is there a goal that people can focus on.In an online experiment during the Covid-19 pandemic, we test how the cognitive performance of university students responds to topics discussing (i) current mental health issues related to social restrictions or (ii) future labor market uncertainties linked to the economic contraction. Moreover, we study how the response is affected by a performance goal by conditioning payout on reaching a minimum level. We find that the labor market topic increases cognitive performance when performance is motivated by a goal. Conversely, there is no such effect after the mental health topic. We even find a weak negative effect among those mentally vulnerable when payout is not based on reaching a goal. The positive effect is driven by students with larger financial and social resources, pointing at an inequality-widening mechanism.</font><p>

<p><font size="-1"><strong>Abstract:</strong>How do states rebuild nations after a major conflict? Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs) have emerged as one of the most common interventions to achieve this objective. Despite their popularity, little is known about their efficacy to foster reconciliation and nation building. We fill this gap by studying the seminal TRC established in South Africa after the end of the Apartheid. To measure exposure to TRC across South African municipalities, we leverage quasi-random variation in media coverage of the TRC message. South African municipalities with higher historical exposure to TRC on media have lower levels of violence today. This effect is driven by improved nation building and higher trust towards post-Apartheid institutions. Exploiting daily variation in TRC hearings and mediatic exposure in the short run, we bolster our interpretation that our long-run results are forged in the years of TRC activity. The same evidence suggests that our results are driven by the coverage of TRC on media as opposed to generic media exposure.</font><p>

<h2><strong>Conflict and Educational Mobility: Evidence from Colombia</strong></h2>

<p><font size="-1"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Does conflict impact socioeconomic mobility? This paper examines the extent to which individuals’ exposure to conflict affects intergenerational mobility in education attainment in Colombia. Exploiting exogenous variation in conflict intensity caused by the distance to the nearest military base and US military assistance. I find that the armed conflict reduces the transmission of parents’ educational outcomes on children’s outcomes. An effect driven by the breakdown in transmission in highly educated families. This disruption occurs mainly due to conflict exposure in early childhood and exposure to conflict-related displacement and sexual violence. Notably, weakening the parent-child link is translated into a general increase in downward mobility and a decrease in upward mobility. Destruction of educational resources and a decrease in children’s aspirations are the likely mechanisms for the observed effect.</font><p>
