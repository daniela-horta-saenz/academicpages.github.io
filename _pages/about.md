Welcome to my werbsite!


<p style="text-align: justify">

I am a PhD candidate at **Aix-Marseille School of Economics** and a Teaching Fellow (ATER) at **Sciences Po Paris**. 

I visited the **University of Chicago** in the Spring of 2023, sponsored by Prof. Oeindrila Dube. I am currently visiting the **University of Cape Town**. 


 
<p style="text-align: justify">
  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **development economics**, **political economy**, and **conflict**, with a primary focus on South Africa and Colombia. My current research projects examine the legacy of conflict and conflict resolution policies on nation-building and human capital accumulation. I am also keen on studying the cultural and institutional factors that reinforce sexual and gender-based violence in fragile states.
