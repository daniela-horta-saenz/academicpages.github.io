Welcome to my website!
</p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify">
I am a PhD candidate at <b> Aix-Marseille School of Economics</b>  and a Teaching Fellow (ATER) at <b> Sciences Po Paris</b>. I visited the <b> University of Chicago</b>  in the Spring of 2023, sponsored by Prof. Oeindrila Dube. 
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
  
My research interests lie at the intersection of <b> development economics</b>, <b> political economy</b>, and <b> conflict</b>, with a primary focus on South Africa and Colombia. My current research projects examine the legacy of conflict and conflict resolution policies on nation-building and human capital accumulation. I am also keen on studying the cultural and institutional factors that reinforce sexual and gender-based violence in fragile states.
